# Caddyserver with Cloudflare and Caddy-Security

This image was created for use with Unraid, but it works just as well for any docker implementation.
I try to keep this package updated regularly to keep up with Caddy development and releases.

This image is compiled with the following addons:
* Cloudflare
* Caddy Security

The Unraid templates assumes EntraID (previously Azure AD) is being used as the Identity Provider (IdP)
Documentation is WIP.
