# Caddyserver with Cloudflare and Caddy-Security

This image was created for use with Unraid, but it works just as well for any docker implementation.
I try updating this image regularly to keep up with Caddy development and releases.

This image is compiled with:
* Cloudflare
* Caddy Security

Documentation is WIP.
